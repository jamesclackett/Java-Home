JDBC (Java Database Connection):
> Is a tool or api for establishing a connection between a java application
  and a standard database
> JDBC is the middle-man between an application and the database. Whether the
  database is external or embedded in the app itself, JDBC is needed to talk
  to it.
> This IDEA module will showcase JDBC with an embedded database, but the ideas
  apply to an external DB also.
