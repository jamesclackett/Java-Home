Layout Manager = Defines the natural layout for components within a container

3 common managers:
    > Border Layout = places components in 5 areas (North, East, South, West, Center)
                      extra space is placed in center area
    > Flow Layout = places components in a row, sized at their preferred size.
                    if the horizontal space is too low, the next available row will be used
    > Grid layout = places components in a grid of cells.
                    each component takes all the available space within its cell, and each
                    cell is the same size
